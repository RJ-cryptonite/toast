<h2><b>Pumas</b></h2>

<body>
<p><b>The Puma concolor, also commonly known as the mountain lion, puma, cougar or
    panther is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Puma
    is the largest of the small cat species. Life span for puma in the wild is between
    8 to 13 years and in captivity up to 20 years.</b></p>
     <h2><b>Giraffes</b></h2>
     <p><b>Giraffes are the tallest mammal in the world. Their long legs and necks help
        them to eat leaves at the top of tall trees that other animals cannot reach.
         They have long tongues, and no teeth at the front of their top jaw, which
         helps them to rip leaves from branches. Male giraffes use their necks for
         fighting, swinging them from side to side to headbutt their opponent.</b></p>
         <h2><b>Lions</b></h2>
         <p><b>Lions are the only big cats to live in groups, called prides. Prides are
           close family groups.They work together to defend territory and hunt.The
           females in the pride tend to do the majority of the hunting.They work
           as a group and use intelligent hunting tactics to catch prey which they
           would not be able to catch alone as they are faster than them.</b></p>
           <h2><b>Elephants</b></h2>
           <p><b>There are numerous types of elephants found in Africa and Asia, with
              three distinct species and at least three subspecies. The African Bush
               Elephant (a.k.a. African Savanna Elephant) is the largest of them all.
                It is actually the largest living terrestrial animal on the planet.
                It is also the most numerous of the elephant species, though it is
                increasingly vulnerable to extinction due to habitat loss and poaching.</b></p>
                <h2><b>Zebras</b></h2>
                <p><b>The zebra is actually mostly covered in white and striped with black
                   or dark brown stripes, but underneath their coat is black skin.There
                   are different types of zebra, each with a different stripe pattern.
                   The mountain zebra normally has vertical stripes on its neck and across
                    its torso while horizontal strips cover their legs.</b></p>
                    <h2><b>Monkeys</b></h2>
                    <p><b>There are currently 264 known monkey species.Monkeys can be divided
                       into two groups, Old World monkeys that live in Africa and Asia,and
                       New World monkeys that live in South America.A baboon is an example
                       of an Old World monkey, while a marmoset is an example of a New World
                       monkey.Apes are not monkeys.Some monkeys live on the ground, while
                       others live in trees.Different monkey species eat a variety of
                       , such as fruit, insects, flowers, leaves and reptiles.</b></p>
